#### DAT264x: Microsoft Professional Capstone : Artificial Intelligence - Dec 2019
 
In this challenge, I had to use standard AI tools to identify 11 different types of appliances from their electric signatures, quantified by current and voltage measurements.

The plug load dataset provided contained current and voltage measurements sampled at 30 kHz from 11 different appliance types present in more than 60 households in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Plus load refers to the energy used by products that are powered by means of an ordinary AC plug (i.e., plugged into an outlet).

For each appliance, plug load measurements were post-processed to extract a three-second-long window of measurements of current and voltage. For some observations, the window contains both the startup transient state (turning the appliance on) as well as the steady-state operation (once the appliance is running).

For others, the window only contains the steady-state operation. The observations were then transformed into two spectrograms, one for current, and one for voltage.
